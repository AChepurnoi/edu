# Homework Tasks

You have to do the url_segmentation because it's super interesting. It's 10 points.

As for the regex tasks, you can EITHER do the email_regex (it's a much more structured task), or, if you want something a bit more creative, do the ELIZA bot instead. So you can do either of those tasks for 10 points.

If you do all three tasks, I will give you 20 points and will buy you a beverage of your choice.
